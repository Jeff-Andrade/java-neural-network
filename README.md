# java-neural-network
This project seeks to develop a prototype for a working feedforward neural network, written solely in Java.

Intended features for implementation:

  - Backpropagation optimization;
  - Hyperparameter tuning (epoch number, batch size and learning rate);
  - Graphical User Interface for architecture visualization;
  - Support for image recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs);
